# Vacationer
Have you always dreamed of getting away to an exotic location? Well, keep dreaming because this is just a fun little project that won't really take you anywhere. It can't make reservations and it won't book your flight.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice and express: 
* compentency in composition with React components
* writing JavaScript inside of React components and component lifecycle hooks
* styling React components (inline vs. stylesheet)

Vacationer was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
