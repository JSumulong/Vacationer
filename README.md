<!-- Have you always dreamed of getting away to an exotic location? Well, keep dreaming because this is just a fun little project that won't really take you anywhere. It can't make reservations and it won't book your flight. -->

## Purpose
This project was built with React, React-Router, and Express.js. The emphasis is on front end development and design, so it's not hooked into a database and it lacks some of the bells and whistles of a fully functioning web application, but I did make use of express.js to provide a lightweight backend. The site itself is a sort of mock travel agency web app (think Airbnb). 

## What I learned
This project helped me to learn more about composition with React, filling in some of the gaps that I hadn't touched on in previous react.js projects. Here are some of the areas in which I learned a lot/developed a deeper understanding:
* Composition with React components - Developing the react.js way
* Writing JavaScript inside of React components and component lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount(), etc...).
* Styling React components (inline vs. stylesheet / styling pseudoclasses with React components)
* Basic routing with React-Router
* Building a simple Node server with express.js
